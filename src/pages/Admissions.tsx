            <li>
              Parents are to visit the school and obtain our admission form for
              a nonrefundable fee of â‚¦15,000
            </li>
            <li>
              After submission of the form, the child will take an entrance
              examination (CBT or PPT). The expected cutoff mark for admission
              is 50% and above. Any child who scores lower will not be admitted
              into the school.
            </li>
            <li>
              After two weeks of taking the entrance examination, the successful
              candidates will be invited for an interview session with the
              admissions team for an oral test.
            </li>
            <li>
              On successful completion of the interview, a copy of the child's
              transcript for the last class/school MUST be presented to the
              admissions team.
            </li>
            <li>
              Parents are to therefore proceed to make at least a 50%-payment of
              the tuition fee within a stipulated period of time as directed by
              the admissions team. The remaining 50% tuition fee MUST be
              completed by at most the first week of resumption. A full one-time
              payment can however be made.
            </li>
            <li>
              All admitted students will be given an orientation on the first
              week
