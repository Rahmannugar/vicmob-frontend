            VICMOB Private School was founded on September 16, 1996, by Pastor
            David and Deaconess Adeola Ogunseye. The establishment was
            officially commissioned by Mrs. Wami Akinoso, Deaconess Adeola's
            former boss from her 17-year tenure at Toria School. Vicmob Private
            School began with a modest enrollment of 35 students, supported by a
            dedicated team of five teachers (two males and three females) along
            with a bursar. The schoolâ€™s original colors, cream and dark brown,
            were later changed to a new color scheme, symbolizing its growth and
            evolution over time. After years of dedication and nurturing young
            minds, the school celebrated a milestone in 2003, when its first set
            of primary 6 pupils graduated, marking 11 successful years of
            operation. Building on this success, VICMOB High School was
            established on September 17, 2007. The high school opened its doors
            with 11 students and a teaching staff of five, continuing the legacy
            of academic excellence set by the primary school. Together, VICMOB
            Private School and VICMOB High School have stood as pillars of
            educational development in the community.
