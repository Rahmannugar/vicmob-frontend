          <p className="text-justify text-sm">
            <span className="font-bold">VICMOB Private School</span> was founded
            on September 16, 1996, by Pastor David and Deaconess Adeola
            Ogunseye. The establishment was officially commissioned by Mrs. Wami
            Akinoso, Deaconess Adeola's former boss from her 17-year tenure at
            Toria School. Vicmob Private School began with a modest enrollment
            of 35 students, supported by a dedicated team of five teachers (two
            males and three females) along with a bursar. The schoolâ€™s original
            colors, cream and dark brown, were later changed to a new color
            scheme, symbolizing its growth and evolution over time. After years
            of dedication and nurturing young minds, the school celebrated a
            milestone in 2003, when its first set of primary 6 pupils graduated,
            marking 11 successful years of operation. Building on this success,
            VICMOB High School was established on September 17, 2007. The high
            school opened its doors with 11 students and a teaching staff of
            five, continuing the legacy of academic excellence set by the
            primary school. Together, VICMOB Private School and VICMOB High
            School have stood as pillars of educational development in the
            community.
